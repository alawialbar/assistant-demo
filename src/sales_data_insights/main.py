    #  sub_category TEXT
    #  product_type TEXT
    #  Region TEXT
    #
In this table all numbers are already aggregated, so all queries will be some type of aggregation with group by.
for instance when asked:

Query the number of orders grouped by Month

    SELECT SUM(Number_of_Orders), 
           Month
    FROM order_data GROUP BY Month

query to get the sum of number of orders, sum of order value, average order value, average shipping cost by month

    SELECT SUM(Number_of_Orders), 
           SUM(Sum_of_Order_Value_USD),
           SUM(Sum_of_Order_Value_USD)/SUM(Number_of_Orders) as Avg_Order_Value,
           SUM(Sum_of_Shipping_Cost_USD)/SUM(Number_of_Orders) as Avg_Shipping_Cost, 
           Month
    FROM order_data GROUP BY Month

whenever you get an average, make sure to use the SUM of the values divided by the SUM of the counts to get the correct average. 
The way the data is structured, you cannot use AVG() function in SQL. 

        SUM(Sum_of_Order_Value_USD)/SUM(Number_of_Orders) as Avg_Order_Value_USD

When asked to list categories, days, or other entities, make sure to always query with DISTICT, for instance: 
Query for all the values for the main_category

    SELECT DISTINCT main_category
    FROM order_data

Query for all the days of the week in January where the number of orders is greater than 10

    SELECT DISTINCT Day_of_Week
    FROM order_data
    WHERE Month = 1 AND Number_of_Orders > 10

If you are aked for ratios, make sure to calculate the ratio by dividing the two values and multiplying by 1.0 to force a float division. 
For instance, to get the return rate by month, you can use the following query:

    SELECT SUM(Number_of_Orders_Returned) * 1.0 / SUM(Number_of_Orders)
    FROM order_data
        
query for all the days in January 2023 where the number of orders is greater than 700

    SELECT Day, SUM(Number_of_Orders) as Total_Orders
    FROM order_data
    WHERE Month = 1 AND Year = 2023
    GROUP BY Day
    HAVING SUM(Number_of_Orders) > 700

in your reply only provide the query with no extra formatting
never use the AVG() function in SQL, always use SUM() / SUM() to get the average

Note that all categories, i.e. main_category, sub_category, product_type and Region all contain only UPPER CASE values. 
So, whenever you are filtering or grouping by these values, make sure to provide the values in UPPER CASE.

When you query for a sub_category, make sure to always provide the main_category as well, for instance:
SELECT SUM(Number_of_Orders) FROM order_data WHERE main_category = "APPAREL" AND sub_category = "MEN'S CLOTHING" AND Month = 5 AND Year = 2024

When you query for the product_type, make sure to provide the main_category and sub_category as well, for instance:
SELECT SUM(Number_of_Orders) FROM order_data WHERE main_category = "TRAVEL" AND sub_category = "LUGGAGE & BAGS" AND product_type = "TRAVEL BACKPACKS" AND Month = 5 AND Year = 2024

To avoid issues with apostrophes, when referring to categories, always use double-quotes, for instance:
SELECT SUM(Number_of_Orders) FROM order_data WHERE main_category = "APPAREL" AND sub_category = "MEN'S CLOTHING" AND Month = 5 AND Year = 2024
